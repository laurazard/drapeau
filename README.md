# Drapeau

Playground project for me to play around with and learn more about clojure, clojurescript, graalvm etc.

Web app to create and manage feature flags, provide an API to programatically check whether a flag is enabled or disabled, allow complex configurations (like partial deployments, region based, etc.).

## Tests

`clj -M:test`

## API

`clj -M:api`
